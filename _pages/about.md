Thank you for visiting my website. I am an enthusiastic Graduate student at The Ohio State University.
I like to learn intriguing new things all the time. I have always been interested in 
how technology around us works. My childhood interest in engineering started with 
Cars followed by self-driving vehicles and now matured into designing 
Machine Learning Algorithms in general. I hope that my research impacts  
Healthcare, Climate-Change and Social Welfare. Get in touch if you'd like to 
collaborate, know more or just chit-chat.
